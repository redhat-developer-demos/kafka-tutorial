= Kafka Streams Intro
include::_attributes.adoc[]

So far, you've seen that you can produce to and consume from Kafka topics, but sometimes you want to do more advanced things: joining records from different topics, grouping and aggregating records, or processing data on the fly and produce the result into another topic.

[#whatkstreams]
== What are Kafka Streams?

Kafka Streams is a Java API that implements all these more advanced features, while processing records in a fault-tolerant and scalable way.
One of the important things to understand is that a Kafka Streams application does not(!) run inside a broker, but instead runs in a separate JVM instance - maybe in the same or in a different cluster - but it is a different process.

A Kafka Streams application can be horizontally scaled such that multiple instances can run in parallel, in different machines and they will automatically collaborate on the data processing.
This is what makes Kafka Streams applications fault-tolerant and scalable.

[#kstreamsconcepts]
== Kafka Streams Concepts

The following is important terminology for Kafka Streams:

Processor Topology:: A topology specifies the data processing logic that needs to be executed by the Kafka Streams application.

Stream Processor:: A stream processor is one particular compute step of the topology. It represents a specific operation to be executed based on a stream. Some examples of built-in operations are: filter, map, join, or aggregate. Usually, a Kafka Streams application is created for one or more such operations defined as the topology.

KStream:: A KStream is a logical abstraction of and unbounded stream of records. Each record is interpreted as a separate "insert" event.

KTable:: A KTable is a logical abstraction of a changelog stream of records. Each record is interpreted as an "update" event in case a record with the same key existed before, otherwise it is interpreted as an "insert" event. This results in a table semantic where key-value pairs always represent the latest value for any given key.
There is two kinds of tables:
* _KTable_: only represents records from a subset of table partitions in case you run multiple application instances
* _GlobalKTable_: always represents records from all partitions of a given topic for every application instance you run

Aggregation Operation:: Takes one input stream or table, and yields a new table by combining multiple input records into a single output record. Examples of aggregations are computing counts or sum.

Join Operation:: Merges two input streams and/or tables based on the keys of their data records, and yields a new stream/table.

Windowing:: Allows to control how to group records that have the same key by different types of time windows. For example, you can group records which have occurred during a certain period of time, say 1 hour.

Interactive Queries:: Treat the stream processing layer as a lightweight embedded key-value store, to directly query the latest state of your stream processing application e.g. based on record keys / key ranges.

:kstreamscat: java -jar kstreamscat.jar

Let's see some of the Kafka Streams concepts in action.

[#kstreamscat]
=== KStreamscat

Note that for the following examples, you are going to use a custom tool called `kstreamscat`. It's a simple custom Java CLI application to explore things like KTables and experiment with different types of windowing.

Pre-built releases can be downloaded from the GitHub repository's https://github.com/lordofthejars/kstreamscat/releases[release page]. In case you want to work with the latest version simply clone the repo and and build the tool by running `./mvnw package`. The `target` directory will contain a runnable JAR file named `kstreamscat-<version>-jar-with-dependencies.jar`.

[#kstreamscat-tables]
=== (Global)KTables

You need only one terminal window to run this section.

Create a new file named `update_songs` with some new songs on it.

[source, json]
.update_songs
----
include::example$update_songs.json[]
----

Then insert each of this line as a new message.
The number before the `:` is taken as an id.

Then inspect the inserted songs using `kcat`:

Notice that the output of `kcat` and `kstreamscat` is fairly the same.
Probably most of you have noticed that `The Imperial March` was not written by Alain Silvestri but by John Williams.
So let's fix this.

Create a file that creates a new event to fix the problem.

[.console-input]
[source, json]
.update2_songs

And add it to the `songs` topic:

Stop the process by typing kbd:[Ctrl + C].

Create a _GlobalKTable_ from `songs` topic:

Stop the process by typing kbd:[Ctrl + C].

Notice that `kcat` shows the content of all the events that have been added into the `songs` topic, so both events referring to the song _The Imperial March_ (key=5/"id":5) are shown.

However, the _GlobalKTable_ just shows the latest values for each key in the topic.
For this reason, only the update event of _The Imperial March_ (key=5/"id":5) is shown, and not the initial insertion.

[#kstreamscat-windowing]
=== Windowing

Windowing allows you to control how to group records that have the same key based on a time window.
For example, you can answer questions like _how many songs has each user played within the last 30 minutes_ or _how many songs has each user played per day_.

There are 4 types of windows:

Tumbling time window:: Fixed-size, non-overlapping, and gap-less.

image::win1.png[]

Hopping time window:: Fixed-size, overlapping windows.

image::win2.png[]

Sliding time window:: Fixed-size, overlapping windows that work on differences between record timestamps. In the case of Kafka Streams, it defines a maximum time difference for a join over two streams on the same key.

Session window:: Dynamically-sized, non-overlapping, data-driven windows. Sessions represent a period of activity separated by a defined gap of inactivity.
This window is used for user behaviour analysis. 

image::win3.png[]

.About Retention
****
Events can be processed out-of-order or late-arriving data records for a given window. 
This means that these events could be processed in the wrong window.
Retention configures the time that a window might remain open to process events that come out-of-order.

image::retention.png[]
****

For this section, you need to open *two* terminals on the same screen.

Let's see how affect different window strategies in a topic that contains the history of the songs that each user has played.

[#kstreamscat-timewindow]
==== Tumbling time window

Let's create a tumbling window of 60 seconds. What we are doing here is creating fixed buckets of 60 seconds each, so that every 60 seconds, a new window is created to process the events that fall into one such tumbling window.

For example, let's count the number of played songs per user in a 60 seconds tumbling window.

With the Kafka cluster started, prepare *but do not yet execute* the next command in terminal 2:

[.console-input]
[source, bash-shell,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
{kstreamscat} --topic=played --id=songs -b=localhost:29092 --time-window=60
----

In terminal 1, run the next command, and then immediately run the command you've prepared in terminal 2:

[tabs]
====

Then in the terminal 1, run again the `kcat` command to insert again the same played song events:

[tabs]
====
kcat::
+
--
[.console-input]
[source, bash-shell]
----
kcat -b localhost:29092 -t played -P -l -K: apps/windowing/first-batch.json

----
--
====

And if you inspect the `kstreamscat` output you'll see:

[.console-output]
[source, bash-shell,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
...
Window: 1673267640000 -> Key: alex = 8
Window: 1673267640000 -> Key: burr = 6
Window: 1673267640000 -> Key: kamesh = 4
Window: 1673267640000 -> Key: edson = 2
Window: 1673267640000 -> Key: sebi = 2
----

Notice that the played song counts have been doubled. This is because the same events were produced and the same time window received the same batch of played songs again.

Now wait for at least one minute and then run the `kcat` command again to insert again the played songs:

[tabs]
====
kcat::
+
--
[.console-input]
[source, bash-shell]
----
kcat -b localhost:29092 -t played -P -l -K: apps/windowing/first-batch.json

----
--
====

And if you inspect the `kstreamscat` output you'll now see:

[.console-output]
[source, bash-shell,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
...
Window: 1673267820000 -> Key: alex = 4

Window: 1673267820000 -> Key: edson = 1
Window: 1673267820000 -> Key: sebi = 1
----

After 1 minute, the window has shifted into a new one and the played song events have fallen into this new window for  which all counters are starting from 0 again.

Window: 1673268716848 -> Key: sebi = 1
----

Notice that we configured the session window to 60 seconds `--session-window=60`. Since until the last sleep (`Sleeping 65`) we were producing content without ever pausing for one minute or longer, all of these events have been processed in the same session window.
The new session window is only created before producing the last batch of song play events because of an inactivity period greater than 60 seconds.
